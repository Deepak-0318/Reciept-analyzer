# Receipt Analyzer

Receipt Analyzer is a full-stack project that enables users to extract, parse, and analyze information from scanned receipts in various formats (images, PDFs, and text). This solution is powered by Python, Tesseract OCR, and Streamlit, with a clean separation between the backend (data extraction, parsing, storage, and analytics) and frontend (Streamlit dashboard and user-facing interface). The core functionality of this project includes extracting text from uploaded receipt images using OCR, identifying key fields such as vendor name, transaction date, total amount, and category, and storing this structured data in a local SQLite database. Once stored, users can view insightful analytics like total spending by category or month, filter records by vendor or date, and sort transactions interactively through the dashboard.

The backend is built in modular Python scripts and includes `ingestion.py` for OCR processing, `parser.py` for field extraction, `database.py` for CRUD operations with SQLite, and `algorithms.py` for analysis and querying. The dashboard component is built using `Streamlit`, allowing users to browse and explore the receipts database visually. Additionally, a user-friendly upload interface is provided under the `frontend/app.py` script to allow new image or PDF receipts to be processed and added to the system. The application supports multiple date formats, common OCR errors, and basic preprocessing to enhance text recognition.

To run the app locally, ensure you have Python and Tesseract installed, install the dependencies listed in `requirement.txt`, and launch the interface using `streamlit run frontend/app.py`. The code is organized under `backend` and `frontend` folders, and a sample receipt is included in the `data/` directory for testing. This project is suitable for those looking to learn about document parsing, OCR, text extraction, and building lightweight dashboards in Python. Contributions and improvements are welcome.
